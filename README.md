# AI Platform Notebook Security Blueprint: Protecting PII Data

This repository provides an opinionated way to set up AI Platform Notebook in a secure way using Terraform.

**This is not an officially supported Google product**

## Reference Architecture
![Reference Architecture](diagrams/notebook_blueprint_arch.png)	   	


The resources that this module will create are:

- One AI Platform Notebook per Notebook user
- Service Account for Notebooks
- an HSM key used for Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) in each Notebook
- Custom Role to restrict exporting data
- Google Cloud Storage bucket with bootstrap code for Notebooks
- Org Policies at the folder that the `trusted-data` project is in
  - `constraints/gcp.resourceLocations`
  - `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountCreation`
  - `constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation`
  - `constraints/iam.automaticIamGrantsForDefaultServiceAccounts`
  - `constraints/compute.requireOsLogin`
  - `constraints/compute.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes`
  - `constraints/compute.restrictSharedVpcSubnetworks`

## Prerequisites

- Deploy the [security foundation blueprint](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation)

## Compatibility

This module is meant for use with Terraform 0.12. Learn how to [upgraded](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-12.html) to the required version.

## Usage

Basic usage of this module is as follows:

```hcl
module "notebooks_blueprint_security" {
  source  = "GoogleCloudPlatform/notebooks-blueprint-security/google"

  vpc_perimeter_regions           = ["US", "DE"]
  vpc_perimeter_policy_name       = "higher_trust_perimeter_policy"
  vpc_perimeter_ip_subnetworks    = ["NETWORK_CIDR"]  # allowed to access VPC-SC perimeters
  zone                            = "us-central1-a"
  resource_locations              = ["in:us-locations", "in:eu-locations"]
  notebook_key_name               = "trusted-data-key"
  dataset_id                      = "sample_ds_for_notebooks"
  notebook_name_prefix            = "trusted-sample"
  bootstrap_notebooks_bucket_name = "notebook_bootstrap"
  default_policy_id               = "12345678"  # likely org id
  project_trusted_analytics       = "trusted-analytics"
  project_trusted_data            = "trusted-data"
  project_trusted_kms             = "trusted-kms"
  trusted_private_network         = "projects/<shared-restricted-prj>/global/networks/<your_vpc>"
  trusted_private_subnet          = "projects/<shared-restricted-prj>/regions/<region>/subnetworks/<your_subnets_for_notebooks>"
  caip_users                      = ["trusted1@example.com", "trusted2@example.com"]
  confid_users                    = ["group:admin@example.com", "group:trusted-users@example.com"]
  trusted_scientists              = ["user:trusted1@example.com", "user:trusted2@example.com"]
}
```

1. Create a tfvars file with the required inputs (see [Inputs](#inputs) section below)
2. `terraform init ` to get the plugins
3. `terraform plan  -var-file="YOUR_FILE.tfvars"` to see the infrastructure plan.  Note: Replace `YOUR_file` with the name of your tfvars file from the first step
4. `terraform apply  -var-file="YOUR_FILE.tfvars"` to apply the infrastructure build. Note: Replace `YOUR_file` with the name of your tfvars file from the first step

5. Access your AI Platform Notebook
    * establish an [SSH tunnel](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/ssh-access) from your device to your AI Platform Notebook
    * in your browser, visit `http://localhost:8080` to access your AI Platform Notebook

Be sure to specify your `projectName`, `dataset`, and `table` below, which should match your terraform.tfvars file.
```
%%bigquery
SELECT
  *
FROM â€˜<projectID>.<dataset>.<table>
LIMIT 10
```

1. `terraform destroy  -var-file="YOUR_FILE.tfvars"` to destroy the built infrastructure. Note: Replace `YOUR_file` with the name of your tfvars file from the first step

### Adding identities to groups
1.  You may need to add service accounts the appropriate IAM high trust data scientist group.
```
# please change the values below to your specific values
gcloud identity groups memberships add --group-email grp-trusted-data-scientists@example.com --member-email = sa-p-notebook-compute@<proj>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### Accessing Notebooks
Use ssh to access your notebook.  Notebooks have no external IP and users should not impersonate the Notebook service account.
Learn how to open an ssh tunnel to launch JuptyerLab, by reading the [SSH to access JupyterLab article](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/ssh-access).


Functional examples are included in the
[examples](./examples/) directory.

- Access Context Manager API: `accesscontextmanager.googleapis.com`
- BigQuery API: `bigquery.googleapis.com`
- Compute Engine API: `compute.googleapis.com`
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) API: `iam.googleapis.com`
- Key Management Service (KMS) API: `cloudkms.googleapis.com`

In order to operate with the Service Account you must activate the following APIs on the project where your KMS/HSM keys reside:

- Google Cloud Storage API: `storage.googleapis.com`
- Key Management Service (KMS) API: `cloudkms.googleapis.com`


### Resource Hierarchy
Within your Org's prod environment, create a folder to hold your trusted projects and centrally managed your policies for Notebooks that use PII data.
Note: the `fldr-prod` is created by the foundation blueprint.  Create folders by using the [project factory](https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-project-factory)

```
fldr-prod
â””â”€â”€ fldr-trusted
    â”œâ”€â”€ trusted-data
    â”œâ”€â”€ trusted-analytics
    â””â”€â”€ trusted-kms
```
