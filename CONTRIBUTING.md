# Contributing

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the module.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies must be installed on the development system:

- [Docker Engine][docker-engine]
- [Google Cloud SDK][google-cloud-sdk]
- [make]

## Generating Documentation for Inputs and Outputs

The Inputs and Outputs tables in the READMEs of the root module,
submodules, and example modules are automatically generated based on
the `variables` and `outputs` of the respective modules. These tables
must be refreshed if the module interfaces are changed.

### Execution

Run `make generate_docs` to generate new Inputs and Outputs tables.

## Integration Testing

Integration tests are used to verify the behavior of the root module,
submodules, and example modules. Additions, changes, and fixes should
be accompanied with tests.

The integration tests are run using [Kitchen][kitchen],
[Kitchen-Terraform][kitchen-terraform], and [InSpec][inspec]. These
tools are packaged within a Docker image for convenience.

The general strategy for these tests is to verify the behavior of the
[example modules](./examples/), thus ensuring that the root module,
submodules, and example modules are all functionally correct.

### Test Environment
The easiest way to test the module is in an isolated test project. The setup for such a project is defined in [test/setup](./test/setup/) directory.

To use this setup, you need a service account with these permissions (on a Folder or Organization):
- see [README](./README#service-account)

The project that the service account belongs to must have the following APIs enabled (the setup won't
create any resources on the service account's project):
- see [README](./README#enable-apis)

Use service account impersonation if your identity doesn't have the necessary roles

```
gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account ${IMPERSONATION_SA}
export GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-access-token)
```

You will also need to set a few environment variables:
```
export TF_VAR_org_id="your_org_id"
export TF_VAR_folder_id="your_folder_id"
export TF_VAR_billing_account="your_billing_account_id"
export TF_VAR_project_trusted_analytics="your_analytics_project_id"
export TF_VAR_project_trusted_data="your_data_project_id"
export TF_VAR_project_trusted_kms="your_kms_project_id"
export TF_VAR_default_policy_id = ${TF_VAR_org_id}  # access policy only accepts org_id
export TF_VAR_vpc_perimeter_ip_subnetworks = "your_subnet_for_vpc_perimeter"
export TF_VAR_confidential_groups = '["group:data-owners@example.com", "group:trusted-data-scientists@example.com"]'
export TF_VAR_trusted_scientists = '["user:scientist1@example.com", "user:scientist2@example.com"]'
```

With these settings in place, you can prepare a test project using Docker.  This creates the following in your test environment based on the `test/setup` directory:

*  BigQuery dataset and table with sample PII data
*  Test service account
*  VPC network and subnet

```
make docker_test_prepare
```

### Noninteractive Execution

Run `make docker_test_integration` to test all of the example modules
noninteractively, using the prepared test project.

### Interactive Execution

1. Run `make docker_test_prepare` to prepare the environment and the testing Docker container in
   interactive mode.

1. Run `make docker_run` to start the testing Docker container in
   interactive mode.

1. Run `kitchen_do create <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to initialize the working
   directory for an example module.

1. Run `kitchen_do converge <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to apply the example module.

1. Run `kitchen_do verify <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to test the example module.

1. Run `kitchen_do destroy <EXAMPLE_NAME>` to destroy the example module
   state.

## Linting and Formatting

Many of the files in the repository can be linted or formatted to
maintain a standard of quality.

### Execution

Run `make docker_test_lint`.
